nHearts

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-NSpire CX with ndless 3.1 or ndless 3.6 and should work on all of the TI-nspire models.  It is a card game.  The goal is have the lowest number of points.  Every card of the hearts suit is 1 point; and the queen of spades is 13 points.  I hope you enjoy it!

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nHearts-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 or ndless 3.6 on your calculator in order to run it!

How to play:
Navigate the menu using the arrow keys (or 2 and 8 keys) and the Enter key to start a new game.
